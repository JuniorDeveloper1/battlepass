# Important infromation!


If you have any troubles with the plugin or any updates,

feel free to message me on discord. Yess#0631. **You can ask for private updates**


### Important > Vault.

You **NEED** VaultAPI!

This plugin uses vaultAPI. You need to have Vault in your plugin asswel as a Economy plugin. Vault can't load the plugin otherwise and Battlepass will disable.

The plugin i used for the economy is :  IConomy. On the vault website you can check for other Economy plugins.
